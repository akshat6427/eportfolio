        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello!
My name is Akshat Singh, I am currently in my 2nd year, pursuing B.Tech in computer
science at Graphic Era Hill University. I completed my schooling from Guru Nanak
Academy Dehradun, where I developed a strong academic foundation and also
participated in various extracurricular activities. My school journey played a major
role in shaping my communication skills, discipline, and teamwork abilities.

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving, and I’m working on
enhancing my technical knowledge through learning C ,C++,python languages. I also
enjoy taking part in projects to gain hands-on experience. Apart from academics, I
like music and reading books , which help me to stay creative and motivated. I
strongly believe in continuous learning and collaboration.

My short term goal is 

 <li>To participate in more projects, internships, and hackathons</li>

 <li>To improve my communication + teamwork abilities</li>

 <li>To maintain a good academic performance</li>

And my long term goals is 

<li>To work in a reputed tech company and contribute to innovative solutions</li>

 <li>To take leadership roles in the future</li>

    Thank you </p>
